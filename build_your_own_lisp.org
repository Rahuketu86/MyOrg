#+TODO:   TODO IN-PROGRESS WAITING DEFFERED DONE

* INTRODUCTION
  This is an exercise in learning multiple things. The objective is manifold :-
  - Learning Org Mode
  - Principles of Literate Programming
  - Learning C
  - Learning a way to implement a new language
  - Learning Lisp
  - And in doing all this - Learning Emacs :)
  
  Long term Goal include:-
  - Learning a method to implement extensible software and organization of software project
  - May be someday an editor like Emacs in Rust/Haskell

  So Stage has been set. Lets' get the ball rolling ...

* SETUP
  I will be following the wonderful tutorial at [[http://www.buildyourownlisp.com][buildyourownlisp.com]] . The basic idea would be to 
  write some code following the tutorial in literate mode and add some accompanying notes :-
  - Learnings :: Things that I have learned.
  - Questions :: Any questions I have.
  - Ideas  :: Some Ideas and thoughts for the future. 

* Code
  The idea is to develop a lisp system which can run in both linux and windows. I will be developing this
  on Ubuntu Machine. So my toolset is going to be :-
  - Compiler
    - Clang and/or gcc for linux

      #+begin_src sh :results verbatim
        gcc --version
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : gcc (Ubuntu 5.3.1-14ubuntu2) 5.3.1 20160413

      #+begin_src sh :results verbatim
        clang --version
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : clang version 3.3 (tags/RELEASE_33/final)
      : Target: i386-pc-linux-gnu
      : Thread model: posix

    - mingw-gcc and wine for windows
      
      #+begin_src sh :results verbatim
        i686-w64-mingw32-gcc --version
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:

      : 

  - Debugger
    - LLDB/ GDB (Need to figure out setup for emacs)
    - Valgrind
  - Editor
    - Emacs Ofcourse! (Might spend some time in setting up configuration for C development)
